Welcome to the EDITH blog ðŸ˜ˆ

The name EDITH came from the movie called "IRON MAN", which means "Even Death I am The Hero".

For my blog, it means "Even Dying I am commiTing the gitHub" (sorry..ã…‹)

The blog is kinda messy.. because the owner of this blog is getting used to this system,

so you can also have fun with seeing some tearful development of this blog.. (and also the blogger..)

I hope you enjoy my blog
